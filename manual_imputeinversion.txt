Manual imputeinversion

Arguments
  -d,--data
Data to be imputed. The input of this argument should be the name of the files to be analysed (without the extension).
If the files are: ecrhs.bed ecrhs.bim ecrhs.fam; then this argument should be used as follows: 
-d colorectal
  
  -i,--inversions
Indicate the inversion regions for which we want the imputed data (the output of the program will be a VCF file with imputed data of the region(s) that we indicate in this argument.
      Valid inputs (in hg19):
         - Coordinates.
               -i 8:8055789-11980649
         - Name of the inversion.
               -i inv8p23.1
         - Text file with the regions of interest. 
               -i genomic_regions.txt
           The separators in the text file can be ' ', ':', '-', '\t'. 



The following three examples would be valid:
7:54290974-54386821    7   54290974   54386821    7 54290974 54386821
8:8055789-11980649     8   8055789   11980649     8 8055789 11980649
17:43661775-44372665   17   43661775   44372665   17 43661775 44372665 
       

- All / ALL / all. This option will impute all the inversions available at the scoreInvHap package (-h,--help shows the availabe inversions)
               -i All
 
  -t,--threads
Integer (by default set to 1). Number of threads that will be used in SHAPEIT and Minimac3. From SHAPEIT user guide: "If there are 1,000 individuals in the dataset, SHAPEIT using 4 threads will phase 4 individuals simultaneously conditional upon the 1000 - 4 = 996 others individuals. It allows to divide the running time of SHAPEIT by almost 4 in this case, so 4 hours becomes 1! This option is recommended only if you have a large number of individuals in your dataset. Note that using a number of threads bigger than the number of available cores will not further decrease the running times."
  
  -h,--help,*
        Shows the Usage, displays help
